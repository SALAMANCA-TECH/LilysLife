Lily's Life (A Systems-Driven Narrative RPG)

1. Project Vision

"Lily's Life" is an interactive, systems-driven RPG and life simulator. It explores themes of identity, perspective, and interpersonal discovery by following the protagonist through a single, transformative day.

The core design principle is "The Outfit as Loadout."

Unlike a traditional "Choose Your Own Adventure" where choices lead to static, pre-written scenes, this project uses a stat-based RPG loop. The player's outfit, chosen at the start of the day, provides base stats. These stats are then tested against dynamic events, and the outcomes of those events modify the stats in turn.

2. Core Mechanics

Mindset Stats: The player's state is tracked by three primary stats:

Cautious: Represents fear, withdrawal, and avoidance.

Curious: Represents analysis, boundary-testing, and observation.

Bold: Represents confidence, confrontation, and acceptance.

The "Dressing Room" Loop: The game begins with the "Dressing Room" mechanic.

The player chooses an outfit piece by piece (e.g., underwear, bra, top, bottom).

Each item is an "Armory" piece with specific stat modifiers (e.g., "Thong" adds +2 Bold, +1 Curious).

The player's choices are finalized, setting their base "Mindset Stats" for the day.

Generative Narrative & Art: The game relies on generative AI to create a dynamic experience.

AI Narrative: Scene descriptions and internal monologues are generated by the Gemini API, directly referencing the player's current stats to reflect their emotional state.

AI Character Art: The character portrait is generated by the Gemini image model, visually combining the "equipped" clothing items onto a base model.

Event Engine (Future Goal): The main game will consist of a series of "Events." Player choices during these events will be gated by their stats (e.g., [Confront Him] (Requires Bold > 5)), and the outcomes will modify their stats, creating a persistent feedback loop.

3. Technology Stack

This project is built as a single-file web application using modern, CDN-based dependencies.

Frontend: HTML5, Tailwind CSS

Logic: JavaScript (ES Modules, async/await)

Backend & Database: Firebase (using Firestore for save/load and Auth for user sessions)

Generative Content: Google Gemini API (for both text and image generation)

4. Project Status

Current Phase: V2.0 - "Dressing Room" Prototype

The immediate goal is to perfect the core "Dressing Room" mechanic. This involves:

Building the 2-column UI (Character Portrait vs. Narrative/Choices).

Implementing the clothingDatabase (the "Armory") with all items and stat modifiers.

Ensuring the gameState correctly tracks equipped items and calculates stats.

Calling the Gemini API to generate narrative text based on stat changes.

Calling the Gemini API to generate the character portrait based on the final "loadout."
